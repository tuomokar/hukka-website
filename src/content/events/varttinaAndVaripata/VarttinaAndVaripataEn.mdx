# Värttinä & Väripata

### What
Would you like to dye threads with natural colors, but you are not sure how to get started? Or are you already an experienced dyer, 
but it would be more fun to do it in company? Would you like to get to know the secrets of spinning? All this is promised at the
Värttinä & Väripata event. Come, see, experience, learn and share your knowledge!

### Where and when

17-19th of May in the Meriharju camp center, Helsinki (Uutelantie 32), Värttinä & Väripata event is organized with the opportunity to 
learn about natural dyeing and yarn spinning. The event is suitable for both beginners and experienced dyers and spinners. During the 
weekend, there will be guidance on spinning and natural dyeing, but also an opportunity for independent dyeing for experienced dyers.

NOTE! Exceptionally, you can also participate in the event in ordinary clothes so that the lack of medieval clothes suitable 
(for danger of getting dirty) would not be an obstacle. Please note, however, that to participate in Saturday's dinner, you'll need medieval clothes.

### Event site

In the building there are 2 dormitories with 12 beds each (bunk beds) and a toilet. Event site offers blankets and a pillow 
for overnight guests. Guests must have their own bed linen. Showers (2 pcs), large economy kitchen, dining room, fireplace room and three 
rooms for small group work. There is also a separate sauna building with two outdoor toilets next to it.

### Event information

The event starts on Friday at 18:00 and ends on Sunday at approx. 13:00. After this, those present are considered to be part of the 
voluntary cleaning assistance. It's also possible to come as a day visitor, which includes Saturday's dinner. You can bring your own drinks 
to the event (preferably only mild alcoholic drinks). We ask everyone to take empty bottles and cans with them, as there is no collection point at the event.
Smoking only in designated smoking areas.

### Food

All foods are prepared lactose-free. If necessary, a gluten-free and vegetarian version is also available. We try to take other food 
restrictions into account as much as possible, but even then we cannot guarantee all possible options, nor that there is no risk of contamination. 
If you are unsure, please contact the autocrat in advance. If necessary, you can prepare your own snacks, in which case we will arrange a 
cold storage space and the possibility of heating.
