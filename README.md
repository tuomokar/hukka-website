# Website of Keskiaikaseura Hukka ry

This is the website for the canton of Hucca, i.e. Keskiaikaseura Hukka ry, a local chapter of the
[barony of Aarnimets√§](https://www.aarnimetsa.org/), which is part of the global Society for Creative Anachronism
([SCA](https://www.sca.org/)).

The site is still very much under construction. Our previous Wordpress site got hacked and our service provider
had to take it down at least temporarily. Because the hacker has attacked our site also previously, it's
unlikely we can get the old site properly secure as simply changing admin and database passwords and cleaning
up malicious code hasn't worked so far.

The site runs at https://www.hukka.org.

## Development

After having cloned the repo, navigate into the repository's directory, and start it up:

```shell
npm run develop
```

The site should now be running at http://localhost:8000

Any updates to the code should be reflected on the local site in real time.
